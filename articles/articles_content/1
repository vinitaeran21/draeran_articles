Incorporating superfoods into your diet can provide a nutrient-rich boost while helping to keep carbohydrates in check. Here are some superfoods that are not only delicious but also low in carbohydrates, making them ideal choices for individuals with diabetes:

Avocados are an excellent source of heart-healthy fats, fiber, and essential nutrients like potassium and vitamin E. With minimal impact on blood sugar levels, avocados make a versatile addition to salads, sandwiches, and smoothies.

### 2. Leafy Greens

Leafy greens such as spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are nutrient powerhouses packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Low in carbohydrates and calories, these greens can be enjoyed raw in salads or cooked as a side dish to complement any meal.

### 3. Berries

Berries like strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries are rich in antioxidants, fiber, and vitamins while being relatively low in carbohydrates compared to other fruits. Enjoy them as a snack, add them to yogurt or oatmeal, or blend them into a refreshing smoothie.

### 4. Nuts and Seeds

Nuts and seeds, such as almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds, are nutritious snacks that provide healthy fats, protein, and fiber. They can help stabilize blood sugar levels and keep you feeling full and satisfied between meals.

### 5. Fatty Fish

Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to improve heart health and reduce inflammation. Incorporating fatty fish into your diet can help support overall well-being while keeping carbohydrates in check.
