**Carb Counting for Beginners**
=============================

### Understanding Carbohydrates
-------------------------

- **Count carbohydrates from all food sources**: Include starches, sugars, milk, yogurt, fruit, and starchy vegetables, not just bread, pasta, rice, and cereals.
- **Recognize carbohydrates in various foods**: They can hide in unexpected places like pasta sauce, salad dressing, and protein bars.

### Counting Carbohydrates
-------------------------

- **Measure your foods**: Use measuring cups and scales to ensure accurate portion sizes.
- **Count carbohydrates in grams**: Use the net grams of carbohydrates listed on labels or calculate them using food composition books.
- **Understand serving sizes and portion sizes**: A serving size is the portion for which nutrition information is calculated, while your portion size may be different. For example, if a label shows 1/2 cup of black beans with 21 grams of carbohydrates, you need to double the carb count if you eat 1 cup.
- **Keep a food diary**: Record your carbohydrate intake to track and adjust your meal plan.

### Tools and Resources
-------------------------
- **Nutrition Facts labels**: Use the net grams of carbohydrates listed on packaged food labels.
- **Exchange Lists for Meal Planning**: The American Diabetes Association provides lists of carbohydrates per exchange serving size.
- **Food composition books and online resources**: Utilize these for calculating carbohydrates in various foods.
- **Restaurant brochures and nutrition apps**: Many restaurants provide nutrition information, and apps like MyFitnessPal or LoseIt can help track carbohydrates.
- **Food scales and measuring cups**: Use these to accurately measure food portions.

### Tips and Strategies
-------------------------
- **Start a food diary**: Track your carbohydrate intake for 3 days to understand your eating patterns and make adjustments.
- **Match insulin doses to carbohydrate intake**: For type 1 diabetes, match your insulin dose to the amount of carbohydrates in your food.
- **Use the plate method**: Divide your plate into sections to visually gauge your carbohydrate intake.

### Additional Tips
